## Instructions for the game
For those who don't know the game, it's a memory based game.
before every level the game will present you the color you need to click, but
you need to remember and click the same colors from the previous levels and at the end click the current one.

### Example:
Level 1 -> Blue
Player should click -> Blue

Level 2 -> Red
Player should click -> Blue, Red
