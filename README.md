The project is a part of my course in Udemy, really enjoyed to build it and i hope you will enjoy the game! <br>

## Technologies

## Instructions for the game
For those who don't know the game, it's a memory based game.<br>
before every level the game will present you the color you need to click, but <br>
you need to remember and click the same colors from the previous levels and at the end click the current one.

### Example:
Level 1 -> Blue <br>
Player should click -> Blue

Level 2 -> Red <br>
Player should click -> Blue, Red
